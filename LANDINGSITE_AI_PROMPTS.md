## Prompt 7: FAQ Section for Security

```
Create a "Security & Privacy FAQ" section for www.nex-genled.com.

Format: Expandable accordion with questions

Q1: "Is my home address safe in your app?"
A: Yes! Your home address is encrypted with AES-256 encryption (the same security banks use) before being stored. Even if someone accessed our database, your address would be unreadable gibberish without your device's unique encryption key.

Q2: "Can you see my WiFi password?"
A: No. We never ask for or store your WiFi password. We only use your network name (SSID) to detect if you're home or away, and even that is hashed (one-way encryption) so we can't read it - we can only verify if it matches.

Q3: "What happens to my voice commands?"
A: Voice commands are processed locally on your device using iOS/Android speech recognition. We never record, store, or upload your voice. When you talk to Lumina AI, only the text transcription is sent (not the audio), and it's rate-limited to 10 requests per hour.

Q4: "Why do you need my location?"
A: We use location for three features (you choose which to enable):
   1. Finding your controllers on your WiFi network (requires location permission on Android)
   2. Geofencing (auto-control when you arrive/leave home)
   3. Sunrise/sunset times for scheduling

   We show you exactly why before asking for permission. Your location is never shared or sold.

Q5: "Can Nex-Gen turn on my lights without permission?"
A: No. Only you (or automations you create) can control your lights. We have zero access to your controllers. Even if our servers were compromised, an attacker couldn't control your lights because:
   1. Controllers are on your local network
   2. We don't store controller passwords
   3. We use encrypted communication

Q6: "What data do you keep, and for how long?"
A:
   - Account info (email, profile): Until you delete your account
   - Usage analytics: 90 days (auto-deleted)
   - Voice transcripts: Not stored
   - Pattern preferences: Until you delete your account
   - OAuth tokens: Until you unlink the integration

Q7: "Are you GDPR/CCPA compliant?"
A: Yes! We comply with:
   - GDPR (EU General Data Protection Regulation)
   - CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)

   You have the right to:
   - Access all your data
   - Delete all your data
   - Export your data
   - Opt out of data collection
   - Know what we collect and why

Q8: "How do I delete all my data?"
A: Go to Settings > Account > Delete Account. This permanently deletes:
   - Your profile and preferences
   - All usage analytics
   - All saved patterns and schedules
   - All OAuth tokens
   - Everything. It's gone forever.

Q9: "Have you had any data breaches?"
A: No. We've never experienced a data breach. Our security measures include:
   - AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Regular security audits
   - Firestore security rules (quarterly reviews)
   - Cryptographically secure tokens

   If a breach ever occurred, we would notify affected users within 72 hours per GDPR requirements.

Q10: "Where can I see your full security documentation?"
A: We believe in transparency. Our full security implementation is documented at:
   - GitHub: [link to SECURITY.md]
   - This website: [link to Security page]
   - Contact: security@nex-genled.com for technical questions

Visual style: Clean accordion, cyan icons for each question

## Implementation Guide for Landingsite.ai

### How to Use These Prompts:

1. **Copy each prompt into landingsite.ai** one at a time
2. **Customize** with your actual:
   - Company name and contact info
   - Customer testimonials (when available)
   - Specific pricing details
   - Links to actual security documentation

3. **Generate variations** by asking landingsite.ai to:
   - Make it more technical (for developers)

4. **A/B test** different messaging:
   - Version A: Focus on "bank-level security"
   - Version B: Focus on "privacy protection"
   - Version C: Focus on "compliance ready"

5. **Consistency check**: Use the same terminology across all pages:
   - "AES-256 encryption" (not "military-grade")
   - "Bank-level security" (consistent metaphor)
   - "90-day retention" (not "deleted after 3 months")
   - "Rate-limited" (technical term, not "controlled")

### Recommended Page Structure:

- Conversion from security page → app download
- Support tickets about privacy/security (should decrease)
