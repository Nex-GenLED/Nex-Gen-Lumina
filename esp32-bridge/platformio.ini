; PlatformIO Project Configuration for Lumina ESP32 Bridge
;
; This firmware runs on an ESP32 and acts as a bridge between
; Firebase Firestore and WLED devices on the local network.
;
; It polls Firestore for pending commands and executes them
; via HTTP to WLED devices, enabling remote control without
; requiring WLED to support MQTT+TLS.
